# Would you rather game

This is a small web based game build on react and redux .

The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.


To start the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
